I really like the character of Lucifer. His role in Catholocism of course and in different forms of Christianity. Modern portrayals of him as a roguish hedonist or pragmatic dealbroker.  

I don't have scholarly knowledge of any of it, but like, if you put a zombie movie on I'll watch it. It doesn't matter what it is, I'll sit and we can talk about the zombies for a pretty long time if you want to.

And same thing for Lucifer. Not that Lucifer is a zombie, but like, that's the tier of enjoyment I'll get from it.

I also like Venus. I'm a Taurus. Marvin the Martian wanted to blow up Earth because it obscured his view of it. The name Robert means "bright, shining" and Lucifer means "Light-Bringer". 

I don't think I'm the devil, it's just one of the properties I attach to the concept of Lucifer.

When I say "I really like" I mean more along the lines of "I enjoy thinking about" not "I think that chap's great". I like the dissonance of Lucifer, betrayer but by necessity. Still a necesary part of the system he rebelled against, trapped in obligation and service, ruler over his domain and first prisoner of it.
