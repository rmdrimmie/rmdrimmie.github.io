I have very slowly been noodling at this again, so be prepared for a flood (eg, very slow trickle approximately four years apart) of new content while i noodle and test. 

Ain't nothing like the meta of setting things up huh?

I wrote the above and flagged it as not published, so now I am changing that value to see if that's all that needs to happen.

It will be nice if it is. I have a set up where I can probably write from my phone and I think that the constraint of dealing with this keyboard will help keep me on the side of publishing without having to address every pre-conceived critique.", even though the real population of readers is going to be very low.
